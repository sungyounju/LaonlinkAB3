# Google Analytics Setup - Quick Start Guide

## âœ… Analytics Code Already Added!

I've already added all the Google Analytics tracking code to your website. You just need to get your Measurement ID and update one file.

---

## Step 1: Create Your Google Analytics Account (2 minutes)

1. **Go to Google Analytics:**
   Visit: https://analytics.google.com

2. **Sign in** with your Google account

3. **Create a new property:**
   - Click **"Start measuring"** or **"Admin"** â†’ **"Create Property"**
   - Enter these details:
     - **Property name:** LaonLinkAB
     - **Time zone:** Sweden
     - **Currency:** EUR (Euro)
   - Click **"Next"**

4. **Fill in business information:**
   - **Industry:** Industrial/Manufacturing
   - **Business size:** Small
   - **Usage:** Track website traffic
   - Click **"Create"**

5. **Get your Measurement ID:**
   - You'll see a screen with your **Measurement ID**
   - It looks like: `G-XXXXXXXXXX` (e.g., `G-ABC123DEF4`)
   - **Copy this ID** - you'll need it next!

---

## Step 2: Add Your Measurement ID (30 seconds)

1. **Open the file:** `index.html`

2. **Find these two lines** (near the top, around line 13 and 20):
   ```html
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
   ```
   and
   ```javascript
   gtag('config', 'YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID', {
   ```

3. **Replace both instances** of `YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your actual ID:
   ```html
   <!-- Before: -->
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>

   <!-- After (example): -->
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ABC123DEF4"></script>
   ```

4. **Save the file**

---

## Step 3: Deploy Your Website

Deploy the updated `index.html` file to your hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

---

## Step 4: Verify It's Working (5 minutes)

1. **Visit your live website** (not localhost - must be the actual deployed site)

2. **Go back to Google Analytics** (https://analytics.google.com)

3. **Click "Reports" â†’ "Realtime"**
   - You should see yourself as a visitor!
   - Click around your site - you'll see the pages change in real-time

4. **If you see yourself - it's working!** ðŸŽ‰

## What Gets Tracked Automatically

I've set up tracking for:

âœ… **Page views** - Every page someone visits
âœ… **Product views** - When someone opens a product modal
âœ… **Add to cart** - When someone adds a product to cart
âœ… **Search queries** - What people search for (with result counts)
âœ… **Category views** - Which categories people browse
âœ… **User location** - What countries visitors come from
âœ… **Device types** - Mobile, tablet, or desktop
âœ… **Traffic sources** - How people find your site

---

## Privacy Settings (Already Configured)

Your analytics is set up with privacy in mind:

- âœ… **IP anonymization enabled** - Visitor IPs are anonymized
- âœ… **No personalized ads** - Google Signals disabled
- âœ… **GDPR-friendly** - Respects user privacy

**The dashboard is PRIVATE** - only you (and people you invite) can see the statistics.

### Still not working?
Check if ad blockers or privacy extensions are blocking Google Analytics (they often do). Try in an incognito window or different browser.
