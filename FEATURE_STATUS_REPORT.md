## ‚ùå NOT WORKING Features

### 1. **Shopping Cart Interface** - MISSING ‚ùå
**Issue:** Cart icon shows item count but there's NO way to:
- View cart contents
- Remove items from cart
- Update quantities
- Proceed to checkout
- See cart total

**What exists:**
- Cart count badge (shows number)
- Add to cart functionality (items are added to localStorage)

**What's missing:**
- Cart dropdown/modal
- Cart page
- View cart button
- Checkout process

**Impact:** Users can add items but cannot view or manage their cart. This is a critical missing feature for an e-commerce site.

**Issue:** "My Account" button is just a static display element

**What's missing:**
- No login/registration system
- No user authentication

**Status:** Currently just a decorative UI element

---

### 3. **Quick Links** - NOT FUNCTIONAL ‚ùå
**Issue:** Navigation links don't work:
- "New Arrivals" (href="#new-arrivals")
- "Best Sellers" (href="#best-sellers")
- "Special Offers" (href="#special-offers")

**What's missing:**
- No logic to filter by new arrivals
- No logic to filter by best sellers
- No special offers functionality

**Status:** Links exist but go nowhere / do nothing

---

### 4. **Language Selector** - PARTIALLY WORKING ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue:** Dropdown exists and code supports Korean, but:
- All Korean text in specifications has been translated to English
- Only product names (name_kr) remain in Korean
- Switching language only changes product names, not much else

**Status:** Functional but limited value since most text is now in English

---

### 5. **"All Categories" Dropdown** - WORKING BUT REDUNDANT ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Works but duplicates the sidebar category tree

---

## üîß PARTIALLY WORKING Features

### Product Data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Model Numbers** - Many products have empty model_number field
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Manufacturer** - Many products have empty manufacturer field

## üéØ Recommendations

### For E-commerce Functionality:

**Option 1: Email-Based Ordering (Simple)**
- Remove "Add to Cart" buttons
- Change to "Request Quote" or "Inquiry" buttons
- All orders handled via email
- No cart needed

**Option 2: Build Cart & Checkout (Complex)**
- Create cart modal/page
- Add cart management (view, edit, remove)
- Implement checkout form
- Add payment integration (Stripe, PayPal)
- Add order confirmation emails

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
- Keep basic cart functionality
- Add "View Cart" modal showing items
- Add "Send Quote Request" button that emails cart to you
- No payment processing - you handle orders manually via email
- Simple but functional

---

### For Account System:

**Option 1: Remove It**
- Remove "My Account" button completely
- Site works fine without accounts

**Option 2: Add Basic Auth**
- Implement login/registration
- Save user preferences
- Track order history
- Requires backend server

**Recommendation:** Remove it for now. Not needed for B2B catalog site.

---

## Current State: Catalog Site vs E-commerce Site

**What you have:**
‚úÖ Product catalog with search/filter
‚úÖ Product details and specifications
‚úÖ Contact/inquiry system
‚úÖ Analytics tracking

**What's missing for full e-commerce:**
‚ùå Cart management UI
‚ùå Checkout process
‚ùå Payment integration
‚ùå Order management
‚ùå User accounts

**Verdict:** Currently a **product catalog** with cart counter, not a full e-commerce site. Works well for B2B inquiries but not for direct online sales.
