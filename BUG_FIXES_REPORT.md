## üî¥ Critical Security Fixes

### 1. Firestore Security Rules Expiration (FIXED)
**File:** `firestore.rules`
**Issue:** Database access was set to expire on November 29, 2025, which would have resulted in complete database lockout.

**Changes:**
- Removed time-based expiration rule
- Implemented proper authentication-based security rules
- Added granular access controls for different data types:
  - Public read access for product catalog
  - User-specific read/write for orders, cart, and user data
  - Admin-only write access for products
  - Authenticated write for analytics

**Impact:** Prevents catastrophic database access failure and improves security posture.

## üü† Runtime Bug Fixes

### 2. Undefined categoriesData Crash (FIXED)
**File:** `js/main.js` - Lines 75-111
**Issue:** Application would crash with "Cannot read properties of undefined" if `categoriesData` failed to load.

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Added validation before initialization
if (typeof categoriesData === 'undefined' || !categoriesData) {
    console.error('Categories data is not loaded or invalid');
    showErrorMessage('Failed to load categories. Please refresh the page.');
    return;
}
```

- Added validation checks for both `productsData` and `categoriesData`
- Implemented try-catch block around initialization
- Created `showErrorMessage()` function to display user-friendly error messages with reload option

**Impact:** Prevents application crashes on startup and provides clear error feedback to users.

### 3. Null Reference Errors in Product Display (FIXED)
**File:** `js/main.js` - Multiple locations
**Issue:** Application would crash when accessing properties of null/undefined products.

**Fixed Locations:**
- **Recently Viewed Products** (Lines 914-943)
  - Added null checks for product objects
  - Added fallback values for missing product names and prices
  - Prevented substring operation on undefined values

- **Product Card Creation** (Lines 830-842)
  - Added validation for product object
  - Added fallback for missing product names
  - Protected against missing image data

- **Product Modal** (Lines 853-878)
  - Added comprehensive null checks for modal elements
  - Added product validation
  - Improved error messages to users

- **Contact Function** (Lines 1065-1086)
  - Added product validation
  - Added fallback values for missing product details
  - Added try-catch for mailto link errors

**Impact:** Eliminates runtime crashes when displaying products with incomplete data.

### 4. Missing DOM Element Checks (FIXED)
**File:** `js/main.js` - Lines 322-429 and throughout
**Issue:** `getElementById` calls without null checks would cause crashes if HTML structure changed.

**Changes:**
- Added null checks before all `addEventListener` calls in `setupEventListeners()`
- Protected all DOM manipulation operations:
  - Search functionality
  - Sort controls
  - View mode toggles
  - Filter controls
  - Pagination controls
  - Breadcrumb updates
  - Welcome message display
  - Back to top button

**Example:**
```javascript
const searchBtn = document.getElementById('searchBtn');
if (searchBtn) {
    searchBtn.addEventListener('click', performSearch);
}
```

**Impact:** Makes application resilient to HTML changes and prevents crashes from missing elements.

### 5. Event Listener Memory Leak (FIXED)
**File:** `js/auth.js` - Lines 71-126
**Issue:** Event listeners were accumulating each time the account menu was opened, potentially causing memory leaks and unexpected behavior.

**Changes:**
- Created global reference to store event listener: `accountMenuCloseHandler`
- Properly remove old listeners before adding new ones
- Clean up listeners when menu is closed

**Impact:** Prevents memory leaks and ensures proper event handling.

## üü° Logic Bug Fixes

### 6. Non-Functional Condition Filter (IMPLEMENTED)
**File:** `js/main.js` - Lines 637-684
**Issue:** Condition filter checkboxes (New/Used/Refurbished) had no effect on product filtering.

**Changes:**
- Implemented `getProductCondition()` helper function
- Function extracts condition from:
  - Product name (supports English and Korean keywords)
  - Product specifications JSON
  - Defaults to 'used' based on catalog composition
- Integrated condition filtering into `applyFilters()` function

**Impact:** Condition filter now works correctly, improving user experience.

### 7. Invalid Price Range Validation (FIXED)
**File:** `js/main.js` - Lines 578-601
**Issue:** Users could set min price > max price, resulting in no results and confusion.

**Changes:**
- Added validation to check if min > max
- Added validation for negative prices
- Added visual feedback (red border) for invalid inputs
- Display clear error messages via notifications

**Impact:** Prevents user confusion and improves filter usability.

### 8. Missing Search Input Validation (FIXED)
**File:** `js/main.js` - Lines 575-615
**Issue:** Search function didn't handle null product properties, could cause crashes.

**Changes:**
- Added null checks for search input element
- Added fallback empty strings for all searchable fields:
  - `product.name_en || ''`
  - `product.name_kr || ''`
  - `product.model_number || ''`
  - `product.manufacturer || ''`
  - Category fields

**Impact:** Search is now robust against incomplete product data.

## üü¢ Code Quality Improvements

### 9. Script Load Order Dependencies (FIXED)
**File:** `js/auth.js` - Lines 5-29
**Issue:** `auth.js` calls `showNotification()` from `main.js`, creating dependency on load order.

**Changes:**
- Implemented `showNotification()` fallback function in `auth.js`
- Function checks for `window.showNotification` first
- Provides standalone implementation if main.js not loaded
- Exported `showNotification` to window object in main.js (Line 1149)

**Impact:** Eliminates dependency issues and makes modules more independent.

### 10. Enhanced Error Handling Throughout Application

**Added Features:**
- Comprehensive error logging with `console.error()` and `console.warn()`
- User-friendly error messages via notifications
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable
- Validation at function entry points
- Try-catch blocks in critical sections

**Improved Functions:**
- `initializeWebsite()` - Full initialization error handling
- `showProductModal()` - Modal element validation
- `contactForProduct()` - Email client error handling
- `performSearch()` - Input validation
- `displayProducts()` - Grid element validation
- `clearFilters()` - Element validation and user feedback

**Impact:** Application handles errors gracefully instead of crashing.

### 11. Additional Improvements

**Clear Filters Enhancement** (Lines 733-756)
- Added null checks for price inputs
- Added user feedback notification "Filters cleared"
- Added logic to show welcome message if no category selected

**Breadcrumb Update** (Lines 525-552)
- Added null check for breadcrumb element
- Added warning log if element missing

**Back to Top Button** (Lines 1110-1130)
- Added validation for button element
- Added warning if button not found in DOM

**Pagination** (Lines 823-827, 1108-1120)
- Added null checks for pagination element
- Added validation in goToPage function
- Protected scroll operation
