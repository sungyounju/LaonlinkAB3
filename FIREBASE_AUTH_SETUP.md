# Firebase Authentication Setup Guide

## What Was Implemented

✅ **Full authentication system** with:
- Login with email/password
- Sign up (create new account)
- Password reset (forgot password)
- User session management
- "My Account" button functionality

## Setup Steps (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project (5 min)

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create a new project:**
   - Click "Add project"
   - Enter project name: **LaonLinkAB**
   - Disable Google Analytics (optional, not needed for auth)
   - Click "Create project"
   - Wait for project to be created

---

### Step 2: Enable Authentication (2 min)

1. **In Firebase Console, click "Authentication"** from left sidebar

2. **Click "Get started"**

3. **Enable Email/Password provider:**
   - Click "Sign-in method" tab
   - Click on "Email/Password"
   - Toggle "Enable" ON
   - Click "Save"

---

### Step 3: Register Web App (3 min)

1. **In Firebase Console, click the gear icon** (⚙️) > "Project settings"

2. **Scroll down to "Your apps" section**

3. **Click the "</>" (Web) icon**

4. **Register your app:**
   - App nickname: **LaonLinkAB Website**
   - Don't check "Firebase Hosting"
   - Click "Register app"

5. **Copy your Firebase configuration**

   You'll see something like this:
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "AIzaSyDOCAbC123dEf456GhI789jKl01-MnO",
     authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
     appId: "1:123456789012:web:abc123def456"
   };
   ```

   **COPY THIS ENTIRE OBJECT** - you'll need it next!

---

### Step 4: Add Configuration to Your Website (5 min)

1. **Open the file:** `js/auth.js`

2. **Find this code** (around line 7-14):
   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };
   ```

3. **Replace it** with your actual configuration you copied in Step 3

   **Before:**
   ```javascript
   apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
   ```

   **After (example):**
   ```javascript
   apiKey: "AIzaSyDOCAbC123dEf456GhI789jKl01-MnO",
   ```

   Do this for ALL fields.

4. **Save the file**

---

### Step 5: Deploy and Test (Optional - 2 min)

**Testing Locally:**
You can test locally, but you need to add `localhost` to authorized domains:

1. In Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings
2. Scroll to "Authorized domains"
3. Add `localhost` if not already there

**Testing on Live Site:**
Just deploy your website normally. Firebase works automatically on any domain.
